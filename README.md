# Loan-Qualifier-CLI
This program uses a command line interface to ask the user for their loan application information and the path to a comma separated value (CSV) data set of available loans. It filters those loans according to the information provided and offers to save the results to a CSV file. The command line interface is intended to increase usability for the user.

## Technologies

This python 3.7 program uses the sys, fire, questionary, and pathlib libraries as they are current on 9/27/2021. It was tested in a git bash environment in Windows 10 and also works on python 3.8.8. 

It uses calculator functions written to calculate debt to income and loan to value ratios, and filter functions for a list of loans available by the max loan size, credit score, debt to income ratio, and loan to value ratio compared to the user entered amounts.

It uses functions to load and save CSV files.
